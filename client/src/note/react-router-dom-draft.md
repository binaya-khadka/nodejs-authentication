# react-router-dom 

### installing 
```bash
npm install react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by
```

The npm install react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by command is installing multiple packages for a JavaScript project:

`react-router-dom`: This is a package that contains the DOM bindings for React Router. It is used for handling routing in React web applications.
`localforage`: This is a fast and simple storage library for JavaScript. It improves the offline experience of your web app by using asynchronous storage (IndexedDB or WebSQL) with a simple, localStorage-like API 1.
`match-sorter`: This is a library that provides simple, expected, and deterministic best-match sorting of an array in JavaScript. It's useful for filtering and sorting items in a way that's intuitive for users, such as when typing in a search bar. It allows you to rank the results by various criteria and provides a stable, alphabetic sort as the default behavior 24.
`sort-by`: This package was not explicitly described in the sources provided, but based on the naming convention, it is likely a utility for sorting arrays of objects by one or multiple properties. It's a common task in JavaScript to sort data, and a package like sort-by would provide a concise and readable way to perform such sorting operations.
The use of these packages together in a project would typically be for a web application with React that requires routing (with react-router-dom), offline data storage or improved caching (localforage), and advanced sorting and filtering functionality (match-sorter). The sort-by package would also assist in sorting operations, though its specific usage would depend on the needs of the project.

The GitHub issue from 0 indicates that someone was questioning the necessity of these packages in a tutorial example, noting that the tutorial did not further elaborate on their usage beyond installation. The response in the issue thread clarifies that these packages are used in the contacts module that the user must copy and paste into their project.
